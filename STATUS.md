## Last Session Summary
Session 28 pre-splintered Part 1 research sessions P1_S5, P1_S6, P1_S7, and P1_S8 before they run.

**What was done:**
1. **Manifest updated** — P1_S5, P1_S6, P1_S7, P1_S8 marked as `splintered` (status, output_file: null, combined context_pack_file, splinter_children populated)
2. **10 new sub-session prompt files written** — all complete, self-contained research prompts:
   - P1_S5-A: Compounding Branch L3-L6 (40-60 nodes)
   - P1_S5-B: Controlled Substances Branch L3-L6 (40-60 nodes)
   - P1_S6-A: FDA Regulation Branch L3-L6 (50-70 nodes)
   - P1_S6-B: Telehealth Branch L3-L6 (30-45 nodes)
   - P1_S7-A: HIPAA & Privacy + Medicare & Billing L3-L4 (55-75 nodes)
   - P1_S7-B: Fraud/Compliance + Operations + Safety + Employment L3-L4 (45-70 nodes)
   - P1_S7-C: Cross-Classification Master Table (synthesis of all S5-S7 branches)
   - P1_S8-A: CFR Mapping Titles 21 & 42 (~150-200 rows)
   - P1_S8-B: CFR Mapping All Remaining Titles (~100-150 rows)
   - P1_S8-C: Agency + openFDA Mapping + Implementation Reference
3. **P2 and P3 context_inputs updated** — now reference P1_S8-A/B/C raw outputs (P1_S8.md won't exist)
4. **DAG validated** — no cycles, all 10 new sub-sessions show as planned, P1_S4 still the only ready session

**DAG after splintering:**
- Splintered parents: 5 (P1_S2, P1_S5, P1_S6, P1_S7, P1_S8)
- Total sessions: 24 (was 14 before this session)
- Complete: 5 | Splintered: 5 | Blocked: 1 | Planned: 13 | Ready: 1 (P1_S4)

**Notes on orchestrator behavior with splintered parents:**
The orchestrator's `isDependencySatisfied` correctly treats a splintered parent as satisfied when all
its children are complete. Downstream sessions (P2, P3) depend on P1_S8 and will be unblocked when
P1_S8-A, P1_S8-B, and P1_S8-C are all complete. P2/P3 context_inputs have been updated to directly
reference the P1_S8 children's raw output files.

**Findings (ordered by severity):**

1. **HIGH — P1_S4 prompt claimed Session 2 dependency** — The S4 prompt said "attach Sessions 1, 2, and 3" but the manifest correctly lists only P1_S1 and P1_S3. Session 2 (part-level allowlists) provides granular CFR part data consumed by Session 8, not by the L1/L2 taxonomy design. Fixed: updated prompt to match manifest, added explanatory note.

2. **HIGH — Context pack metadata hallucinations** — P1_S2-B.yaml had `session_id: "P2_S1"` (should be "P1_S2-B"), P1_S2-A.yaml had `session_id: "P1_S2"` (should be "P1_S2-A"), P1_S2-C.yaml had `session_id: "P1_S2"` (should be "P1_S2-C"). Fixed: corrected all three.

3. **MEDIUM — Completed prompt files were one-line placeholders** — S1, S2, S2-A, S2-B, S2-C, S3 prompt files contained only "session complete, see output". Fixed: replaced with provenance-preserving placeholders including session ID, title, output/context-pack paths, completion date, and an explicit note that the original prompt text was replaced.

4. **MEDIUM — runner.ts clipboard path fragile** — Used `path.resolve(process.cwd(), '..', '..')` instead of `resolveFromRoot()`. Functionally correct when CWD is `research/orchestrator/`, but fragile. Fixed: switched to `resolveFromRoot()`.

5. **MEDIUM — Web session operator instructions misleading** — CLI said "Paste into claude.ai → select Extended Research (Opus)" with no mention that context packs are pre-injected. Fixed: replaced with numbered operator steps noting context is already included.

6. **LOW — S5-S8 prompts say "attach files as file uploads"** — The orchestrator pre-injects context packs, so this instruction is redundant for automated runs. Not fixed (scope limit) — flagged as residual risk.

7. **LOW — P3 manifest dependencies don't include P2** — The P3 mega-prompt says it depends on "Session 2 output" (meaning Part 2). The manifest note says "splintered sub-sessions will have refined dependencies." Accepted as intentional — the mega-prompt will be splintered before running.

8. **LOW — saveManifest strips YAML comments** — js-yaml doesn't preserve comments. The `run` command calls saveManifest, which strips all section dividers and inline comments from manifest.yaml. Not fixed (inherent js-yaml limitation) — flagged as residual risk.

**Validation results (all pass):**
- `npm run research -- status`: DAG valid, 5 complete, 1 splintered, 1 blocked, 7 planned, 1 ready (P1_S4)
- `npm run research -- next`: P1_S4 correctly identified as only ready session
- Dry P1_S4 package generation: context includes P1_S1 + P1_S3 packs (correct), no Session 2 content, prompt references "Sessions 1 and 3" (correct)
- Context pack metadata: all 5 packs have correct session_ids after fixes

## Research Pipeline State
```
DAG Status:
  ✅ complete: 5 (P1_S1, P1_S2-A, P1_S2-B, P1_S2-C, P1_S3)
  🔀 splintered: 5 (P1_S2, P1_S5, P1_S6, P1_S7, P1_S8)
  🔴 blocked: 1 (P1_S2-D)
  📋 planned: 13 (P1_S4, P1_S5-A/B, P1_S6-A/B, P1_S7-A/B/C, P1_S8-A/B/C, P2, P3)
  🟢 ready: 1 (P1_S4)

Critical path: P1_S4 → P1_S5-A → P1_S5-B → P1_S6-A → P1_S6-B → P1_S8-A → P1_S8-C
Progress: 10/24 sessions complete/splintered

Next session ready: P1_S4 [WEB] — Domain Taxonomy L1/L2 Structure
  Dependencies: P1_S1 ✅, P1_S3 ✅
  Run: npm run research -- run P1_S4

After P1_S4 completes, 3 sessions become ready simultaneously:
  P1_S5-A [WEB] — Compounding Branch (critical path)
  P1_S7-A [WEB] — HIPAA & Privacy + Medicare & Billing (parallel)
  P1_S7-B [WEB] — Fraud/Compliance + Operations + Safety + Employment (parallel)
```

## Next Session Priority
**Research pipeline execution — begin P1_S4:**
1. Run `npm run research -- run P1_S4` to prepare web session package (package already exists locally at `research/outputs/part1/P1_S4-package.md`)
2. Execute in claude.ai (Extended Research / Opus), save output to `research/outputs/part1/P1_S4.md`
3. Run `npm run research -- complete P1_S4` to generate context pack and unlock P1_S5-A, P1_S7-A, P1_S7-B

**Previous priorities (still pending after orchestrator work):**
3. **Trigger Phase 3 scoring pipeline** (in order via Inngest dev dashboard — start dev server first with `env -u ANTHROPIC_API_KEY npx next dev --port 3000`):
   - `cedar/corpus.classify` — populates `kg_entity_domains`
   - `cedar/corpus.authority-classify` — populates `authority_level` + `issuing_agency`
   - `cedar/corpus.practice-score` — populates `kg_entity_practice_relevance`; refreshes views
   - `cedar/corpus.service-line-map` — populates `kg_service_line_regulations`
4. **Verify library UI** after pipeline runs
5. **Visual spot-check** admin pages in dark mode

### Dev Server Startup
```bash
env -u ANTHROPIC_API_KEY npx next dev --port 3000

## Known Issues
- FAQ page has 8 hardcoded items (intentional — gated to Intelligence tier)
- Zero test files in the project (notable gap for a compliance platform)
- FL Administrative Register URL (`flrules.org`) has an empty `id=` param — likely needs a real rule number
- FR ingest: `PROPOSED_RULE` filter returns 0 results — only Rules and Notices were ingested
- Phase 3 scoring functions not yet triggered — library category counts will show 0 until pipeline runs
- Supabase CLI binary not installed via npm (broken symlink); use cached npx path: `/Users/anthonyrilling/.npm/_npx/b96a6bd565c470ce/node_modules/supabase/bin/supabase` with `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` env var set
- Production Supabase instance needs migration reset — all 27 migrations rewritten for best practices audit
- `changes/page.tsx` severity filter tabs use a local `SEVERITY_ACTIVE_CLASS` map (Radix color props can't be used on `<Link>` elements directly) — acceptable but note for future design system audit

## Blockers
- Railway/Docling deployment needed for Module 4 (PDF processing)

- Credentials configured in Vercel: Oxylabs ✅, Browserbase ✅, Resend ✅, WorkOS ✅, Inngest ✅, Stripe ✅, GITHUB_PAT ✅, SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN ✅, VERCEL_TOKEN ✅, ADMIN_SECRET ✅
