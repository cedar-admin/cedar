# Cedar

Regulatory intelligence platform for Florida medical practices. Monitors 71 regulatory sources, detects changes, classifies them through an AI pipeline, and delivers plain-language alerts with a tamper-evident audit trail. Information-only platform — Cedar provides regulatory monitoring, summaries, and FAQs. Cedar does not provide legal advice.

## Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 App Router, TypeScript
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + RLS + Storage)
- **Scheduling:** Inngest
- **Hosting:** Vercel (main app) + Railway (Docling microservice)
- **Auth:** WorkOS AuthKit (roles: practice_owner, reviewer, admin)
- **Email:** Resend
- **Billing:** Stripe
- **Fetching:** Gov APIs → Oxylabs → BrowserBase (auto-escalating)
- **AI:** Anthropic Claude API (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`)
- **Push:** OneSignal (1.0 Full, Intelligence tier only)

## Session Startup — Read in This Order

1. Read this file (automatic)
2. Read `STATUS.md` for current build state, last session summary, and next priority
3. If a PRP exists in `PRPs/active/`, read it — that is your task for this session
4. Read relevant source files before modifying them — always verify against the actual codebase

## Module Build Order

1. Data Layer (Supabase schema, RLS, WorkOS, Stripe) ✅ DONE
2. Orchestration (Inngest scheduler + monitorSource + delivery) ✅ DONE
3. Source Fetching (auto-escalating dispatcher) ✅ DONE
4. Document Processing (Docling + Whisper) — 🔲 Blocked on Railway deploy
5. Change Detection (hash + diff + chain) ✅ DONE
6. Intelligence Pipeline (3 agents, sequential) — Agents 1+2 DONE, Agent 3 deferred to 1.0 Full
6B. HITL Review Layer — ⚙️ Partial (routes work, rule-matching incomplete)
7. Audit Trail + Knowledge Graph — ⚙️ Partial (chain validator works, KG writes inline, snapshot.ts stub)
8. Delivery (Resend + OneSignal) — ✅ Email DONE, OneSignal deferred to 1.0 Full
9. Dashboard (Next.js) — ⚙️ Partial (13 pages, settings toggles don't persist)

**Important:** This list reflects last known state. `STATUS.md` has the current ground truth. Always verify against actual files and migrations.

## Session Discipline

### PRP Workflow (Preferred)
When a PRP exists in `PRPs/active/`:
- The PRP defines the scope for this session. Follow it precisely.
- Do not add scope beyond the PRP. Note future work in `STATUS.md`.
- Run all validation gates in the PRP before marking complete.
- When done: update `STATUS.md`, move PRP to `PRPs/completed/`.

### When No PRP Exists
Fall back to module-order progression:
1. Check `STATUS.md` for the next priority
2. Find the first incomplete module in the build order
3. Within that module, identify the first incomplete component from the codebase
4. Build it, then continue to the next piece within the same module

### Session Behavior

**When you complete a subtask within a module:**
- State what you just built in 2-3 sentences
- State what comes next within the module
- Continue immediately unless there is a blocker

**When you complete a full module:**
- Summarize what was built across the whole module
- List any decisions made and why
- List any open questions or items deferred
- State which module is next and what it entails
- Ask: "Ready to continue to Module X: [name]?"
- Wait for confirmation before starting the next module

**When you hit a blocker:**
- Describe the blocker clearly
- State what you need to resolve it (a decision, a credential, a clarification)
- Do not proceed past the blocker — ask for what you need

**Before ending any session:**
- Update `STATUS.md` with: what was built, what's next, any issues discovered
- Stage, commit, and push all changes (see Git Push procedure below)

**After completing any module or subtask that modifies files:**
- Stage all changed files with `git add -A`
- Commit with a descriptive message (e.g., `feat: Module 9 dashboard live data queries`)
- Push to main using the deploy procedure below
- Confirm the push succeeded before continuing

**Platform operations (Vercel, Supabase, GitHub):**
Use available access tokens to perform all platform operations directly via API or CLI — env var updates, deployments, migrations, git pushes. Never ask the user to perform these manually.

## Git Push & Vercel Deploy Procedure

Vercel is connected to the `cedar-admin/cedar` GitHub repo and auto-deploys on every push to `main`. The CLI deploy path (`vercel deploy --prod`) is unreliable on this account — always use the GitHub push path instead.

**Every push to production must follow these exact steps:**

```bash
# 1. Stage and commit (standard)
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: ..."

# 2. Push using PAT (HTTPS auth is not cached — must embed PAT in URL)
# PAT is stored locally — never commit it. Source from env or credential store.
PAT="$GITHUB_PAT"   # set GITHUB_PAT in your shell profile or .env.local
git remote set-url origin "https://${PAT}@github.com/cedar-admin/cedar.git"
git push origin main
git remote set-url origin "https://github.com/cedar-admin/cedar.git"   # reset — never leave PAT in remote URL

# 3. Verify Vercel picked it up (wait ~10s then poll)
# VERCEL_TOKEN is stored locally — never commit it.
sleep 10s && curl -s "https://api.vercel.com/v6/deployments?projectId=prj_YykyqY89BoocNV2xV3MUWcDjpdxv&limit=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VERCEL_TOKEN" \
  | jq '.deployments[0] | {id: .uid, state, url}'

# 4. If state is BUILDING, poll again after 30s until READY or ERROR
# 5. If state is READY — done. cedar-beta.vercel.app is live.
# 6. If state is ERROR — check build logs before retrying
```

**Why the CLI path fails:** `vercel deploy --prod` (CLI) returns "Unexpected error" immediately on this account — builds complete in 0ms with no logs. Root cause is unknown (likely a Vercel Hobby plan + CLI auth combination). The GitHub push → auto-deploy path works reliably every time.

**Author identity must be `cedar-admin`:** The global git config must be set to match the GitHub account. If commits are authored with a different identity, Vercel may not associate them correctly.

```bash
git config --global user.email "cedaradmin@gmail.com"
git config --global user.name "cedar-admin"
```

If the identity ever gets reset, re-amend the last commit before pushing:
```bash
git commit --amend --reset-author --no-edit
# then push with PAT as above (use --force if already pushed)
```

**Vercel project details:**
- Project ID: `prj_YykyqY89BoocNV2xV3MUWcDjpdxv`
- Production URL: `cedar-beta.vercel.app`
- GitHub repo: `cedar-admin/cedar` (main branch → production)

## Module Test Criteria

A module is not complete until its test criteria pass.

**Module 2 — Orchestration**
- Inngest dashboard shows Cedar functions registered
- A manually triggered `monitor.check` event executes without error
- Kill switch: set `agents_enabled = false` in `feature_flags`, trigger a job, confirm it exits early and logs the skip

**Module 3 — Source Fetching**
- 3 sources fetch successfully and log cost events to `cost_events`
- Dispatcher correctly stores `fetch_method` on first fetch and reuses it on second fetch
- A source that fails Oxylabs escalates to BrowserBase (or logs escalation attempt)

**Module 4 — Document Processing**
- Railway Docling service is live and returns structured Markdown for a test PDF POST
- `docling.ts` client successfully calls the Railway endpoint and returns content
- Whisper transcribes a short audio clip and returns text

**Module 5 — Change Detection**
- Manually modify `last_hash` on a source_url row; confirm a change record is written with correct `chain_hash` and `chain_sequence`
- Confirm `prev_chain_hash` on the new record matches the `chain_hash` of the prior record
- Confirm unmodified sources do not generate change records

**Module 6 — Intelligence Pipeline**
- Agent 1 correctly filters an irrelevant diff (returns `relevant: false`)
- Agent 2 produces valid JSON with all required fields on a real regulatory diff
- `agent_version` is stored on the change record
- Cost event is logged per agent call

**Module 6B — HITL Review Layer**
- A change matching a `review_rules` condition enters `pending_review` and is not delivered
- A change matching no rule gets `review_status = not_required` and proceeds to delivery
- Reviewer can approve/edit/reject from the admin queue; action writes to `review_actions`

**Module 7 — Audit Trail & Knowledge Graph**
- Attempt to UPDATE a `changes` row via SQL — confirm trigger throws
- `chain-validator.ts` detects a tampered hash and writes to `validation_log`
- KG entity is written when a change is recorded

**Module 8 — Delivery**
- An approved change triggers an email via Resend
- Email contains: severity badge, AI summary, source link, disclaimer, acknowledge link
- A `pending_review` change is NOT delivered

**Module 9 — Dashboard**
- All pages render without errors
- Change detail page shows AI summary, structured diff, metadata, source link
- Audit trail page shows validation runs and supports PDF export
- Settings page persists notification preferences to database
- Admin pages are not accessible to practice_owner role

## Non-Negotiable Conventions

**Feature gates:** All tier-based feature checks use `isFeatureEnabled(flagName, practiceTier)` from `lib/features.ts`. Never hardcode tier strings in components.

**Agent prompts:** During MVP, prompts live in code files under `lib/intelligence/prompts/`. Each prompt file exports a version string (e.g., `v0.1.0-code`). Store `agent_version` on every change record from day one. Migrate to `prompt_templates` table after stability is confirmed.

**Cost tracking:** Every external API call (Claude, Oxylabs, BrowserBase, Docling, Whisper, Resend) wrapped with `trackCost()` from `lib/cost-tracker.ts`. No exceptions.

**Audit trail:** `changes` table is append-only, enforced by database trigger. Never `UPDATE` or `DELETE` on `changes`. The trigger has one exception: `review_status`, `reviewed_by`, `reviewed_at`, `review_action`, and `review_notes` are updatable to support the HITL workflow — the trigger must explicitly allow updates to these columns only. Reviewer decisions are also written to the `review_actions` table. Use `superseded_by` to correct a change record.

**RLS:** Anon key subject to RLS. Service role key bypasses RLS. Use anon in client components, service role in Inngest functions and API routes only.

**Jurisdiction:** Every source, change, KG entity has `jurisdiction` column defaulting to `'FL'`. Always set explicitly when querying — never assume Florida-only.

**Disclaimer:** Every AI summary must carry:
> "This summary was generated by AI and has not been reviewed by a licensed attorney. This is not legal advice. For decisions specific to your practice, consult your legal counsel."

## Where Things Live

| Thing | Path |
|-------|------|
| Migrations | `supabase/migrations/` |
| Inngest functions | `inngest/` |
| Fetchers | `lib/fetchers/` |
| Intelligence agents | `lib/intelligence/` |
| Agent prompts (MVP) | `lib/intelligence/prompts/` |
| Cost tracking | `lib/cost-tracker.ts` |
| Feature flags | `lib/features.ts` |
| Env validation | `lib/env.ts` |
| Supabase types | `lib/db/types.ts` (regenerate after schema changes) |
| Dashboard routes | `app/(dashboard)/` |
| Admin routes | `app/(admin)/` |
| Build status | `STATUS.md` |
| Active PRP | `PRPs/active/` |
| Completed PRPs | `PRPs/completed/` |
| PRP template | `PRPs/templates/prp_base.md` |
| Code pattern examples | `examples/patterns/` |
| Architecture reference | `docs/architecture.md` |

## Configuration Tables (read from DB, not code)

- `feature_flags` — what features are enabled per tier
- `prompt_templates` — active agent prompts (post-MVP)
- `system_config` — operational thresholds (cost limits, cron schedules, confidence thresholds, retry limits)
- `review_rules` — HITL routing rules

## Agent 3 Deferral

Agent 3 (Ontology Mapper) is deferred to 1.0 Full. Do not stub or build it during MVP. It activates when:
1. The knowledge graph has been bootstrapped with a one-time seeding workflow
2. The changes table has accumulated sufficient history for meaningful retrieval
3. RAG is activated over the `changes` table and `kg_entities`

Until those conditions are met, `ontology_mapping` on change records stays null.

## Module 4 Prerequisites

Module 4 (Document Processing) requires a live Railway deployment of the Docling microservice before `docling.ts` can be wired. If Railway is not yet deployed when Module 4 is reached, flag this as a blocker and ask for confirmation that Railway is live before proceeding. Do not mock the Docling client — build it against the real endpoint.

## Product Rules

**Information-only platform.** Cedar summarizes what changed. It does NOT provide legal advice or practice-specific directives.

**Two tiers:**
- Monitor ($99/mo): change feed, email alerts, audit trail
- Intelligence ($199/mo): all Monitor + Q&A, knowledge graph, attorney-reviewed content, weekly digest, push notifications

## MVP Scope

10 Critical-tier sources. Single Claude agent (relevance filter + classifier combined). Supabase append-only store. Resend email alert. Minimal dashboard. WorkOS auth.

Success criteria: 3+ sources detect real regulatory changes within 24 hours, AI summary accuracy verified, audit trail correct, alert email arrives.

## Dev Server Startup (Important)

When running inside Claude Code, its shell environment injects `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=` (empty string). Next.js follows shell env priority over `.env.local`, so the key would be empty in Inngest step callbacks. **Always start the dev server with:**

```bash
env -u ANTHROPIC_API_KEY npx next dev --port 3000
```

This unsets the shell variable so `.env.local` takes precedence. Without this, Claude API calls in intelligence agents will fail with authentication errors.

## Access Tokens and API Keys

All secrets are stored in `.env.local` (local dev) and Vercel environment variables (production). Never commit secrets to this file or any version-controlled file.

- **Supabase Access Token** — set in Supabase dashboard, used by CLI
- **Vercel Access Token (cedar-deploy)** — set in Vercel dashboard
- **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** — set in .env.local and Vercel env vars
- **BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID** — set in .env.local and Vercel env vars
- **BROWSERBASE_API_KEY** — set in .env.local and Vercel env vars
- **RESEND_API_KEY** — set in .env.local and Vercel env vars
- **GitHub PAT (cedar-deploy)** — stored locally, used for git push auth

## Design System

Cedar uses a token-based design system enforced through four layers: this file (advisory), on-demand specs (reference), ESLint + token audit (deterministic), and a closed token architecture (structural).

### Before writing or modifying ANY UI code:
1. Read `docs/design-system/design-standards.md` for patterns and principles
2. Check `specs/tokens/token-reference.md` for available tokens
3. Check `src/components/ui/` for existing components
4. If the component has a spec in `specs/components/`, follow it
5. Run `node scripts/token-audit.js` before finishing — zero errors required

### Core rules
- **Colors:** CSS variables only via Tailwind classes (`bg-primary`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`). No hardcoded hex, rgb, hsl, or oklch in components.
- **Spacing:** Tailwind scale only (`p-4`, `gap-2`, `space-y-6`). No arbitrary pixel values (`p-[13px]`).
- **Typography:** Tailwind text classes (`text-sm`, `text-base`, `text-2xl`). All sizes are fluid via clamp().
- **Radius:** Derived scale (`rounded-md`, `rounded-lg`, `rounded-xl`). All derive from base `--radius`. For nested elements: `rounded-[max(0px,calc(var(--radius-xl)-1rem))]`.
- **Shadows:** Token scale (`shadow-sm` through `shadow-xl`).
- **Z-index:** Token scale only (`z-[0]`, `z-[10]`, `z-[40]`, `z-[50]`). See `token-reference.md`.
- **Motion:** Use shared animation classes (`.animate-panel-in-right`, `.animate-scrim-in`, `.transition-interactive`, etc.) from globals.css. Duration tokens: `--duration-fast` through `--duration-slower`. Easing: `--ease-standard`, `--ease-out`, `--ease-in`.
- **No inline styles** except for dynamic values (stagger delays, computed positions).
- **No arbitrary Tailwind values** — ESLint `tailwindcss/no-arbitrary-value` catches these.

### Components
- Use shadcn/ui components from `components/ui/` exclusively
- No raw HTML buttons, inputs, selects, textareas, or form elements
- If a needed component is missing: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [name]`
- New reusable components: write spec in `specs/components/` first, use CVA + cn()
- Rule of three: abstract into a shared component when a pattern appears 3+ times

### Icons
- Remix Icon only (`<i className="ri-[name]-line" />`)
- No other icon libraries (no lucide-react, no heroicons)

### Dark mode
- Semantic tokens handle light/dark automatically (`bg-background`, `text-foreground`)
- Use `dark:` prefix only for non-semantic colors (status badges with raw Tailwind colors)
- Test both modes for every new UI element

### Animation patterns
- Slide-over panels: `.animate-panel-in-right` / `.animate-panel-out-right` on panel, `.animate-scrim-in` on overlay
- Sidebar expand/collapse: `.animate-panel-in-left` / `.animate-panel-out-left`
- Dialogs: `.animate-scale-in` / `.animate-scale-out`
- Hover/focus: `.transition-interactive` or `transition-colors`
- Entering = `--ease-out`, exiting = `--ease-in`
- Only animate `transform` and `opacity` (GPU-composited, 60fps)

### Adding new tokens
1. Check if an existing token works (within ±2px or ±1 shade)
2. If genuinely new and used 3+ places: add to `globals.css`, document in `specs/tokens/token-reference.md`
3. Primitives → `@theme { }`, semantics → `:root` / `.dark`, bridge → `@theme inline { }`

### Token source of truth
All visual tokens live in `src/styles/globals.css`. Reference docs live in `specs/tokens/token-reference.md`. Design principles live in `docs/design-system/design-standards.md`.

## UI Standards

### Shared Components
- **SeverityBadge** (`components/SeverityBadge.tsx`) — use for all severity indicators; never define local severity colors
- **StatusBadge** (`components/StatusBadge.tsx`) — use for all review status badges
- **EmptyState** (`components/EmptyState.tsx`) — use for all "no data" states inside cards
- **DataList** (`components/DataList.tsx`) — use for any clickable list of items with severity + timestamp

### Shared Utilities
- **`lib/ui-constants.ts`** — single source of truth for `SEVERITY_CLASS`, `SEVERITY_DOT`, `SEVERITY_ICON`, `SEVERITIES`, `STATUS_CLASS`, `STATUS_LABEL`
- **`lib/format.ts`** — shared `timeAgo()`, `formatDate()`, `capitalize()` — never define these locally in pages

### Page Layout Patterns
- Outer wrapper: `<div className="space-y-6">`
- Page title: `<h1 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground">`
- Page subtitle: `<p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1">`
- Card section headers: `<CardTitle className="text-xs font-semibold text-muted-foreground uppercase tracking-wide">`
- Empty states: `py-12`, icon `text-3xl`, icon margin `mb-2`
- Back links: `inline-flex items-center gap-1.5 text-sm text-muted-foreground hover:text-foreground mb-6 transition-colors`

### Role vs Tier
- **Role** (admin, intelligence, monitor) — determines permissions and nav visibility
- **Tier** (monitor, intelligence) — determines subscription features and billing
- Never conflate these. Admin accounts have no subscription tier.
- Settings page for admin shows "Role: Admin" with no plan, no Stripe info, no upgrade button
- Sidebar shows: tier name for practice_owners, "Admin" for admins

### Interactive Elements
- All toggles must use `<Switch>` from `@/components/ui/switch` — never fake div-based toggles
- All selects must use shadcn `<Select>` — never native `<select>`
- All buttons must use `<Button>` from `@/components/ui/button`

## Generating Updated Types

After pushing migrations to Supabase:

```bash
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id serumeiwrvtwisibuawe > lib/db/types.ts
```
